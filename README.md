# jPowerMonitor
JUnit Extension and Java Agent for energy consumption measurement.

### Description
The power consumption of Java applications should become measurable, and thus visible, with the help of jPowerMonitor.
This library includes an extension for measuring unit tests, as well as a Java agent for measuring any Java application.
The Java agent collects the activity of the application to be measured at regular, configurable intervals. The agent takes into account the power consumption provided by the configured measurement tool.
The CPU usage of the program and the current power consumption are aggregated to energy consumption per method over runtime and written into a CSV file.
The result of the measurement is the energy consumption in watt hours or joule.

### Quick Start
- Install and configure Tool __Libre Hardware Monitor__: https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor
  - Configure Libre Hardware Monitor to start a web server:
      ![Webserver aktivieren](docs/lhm-webserver.png)
  - If necessary, an alternative port (default port is 8085) can be also activated there.
  - __IMPORTANT: To start the web server, Libre Hardware Monitor may have to be started as administrator.__
  - After that the tool is also accessible in your browser: http://localhost:8085/.
  - The jPowerMonitor JUnit extension and the Java Agent internally read the json document, which can be retrieved at http://localhost:8085/data.json.
- The tool __HWiNFO__ or __another tool that writes sensor values to a CSV file__ could be used alternatively, __measurement -> method__ must be set to 'csv' and Logging to CSV in HWiNFO must be active: https://www.hwinfo.com/
  - Configure HWiNFO to log the values of the power sensors to the CSV file.
  - Start the logging in HWiNFO to a file e.g. in your project directory. 
- To start the __Java agent__, the "fat jar" (incl. dependencies, with name `jpowermonitor-<version>-all.jar`) must be __downloaded from mvn central [here](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/github/msg-systems/jpowermonitor/)__ or __must first be built__ with the Gradle task `shadowJar`.
- __Copy `src/main/resources/jpowermonitor-template.yaml` to the execution directory and rename it to `./jpowermonitor.yaml`__.
- __Configure (at least) measurement -> lhm -> paths -> path to match your machine__ for using Libre Hardware Monitor, or __the CSV section__ to use HWiNFO or __another tool that writes sensor values to a CSV file__.
- For using the __JUnit Extension__ see below section __[JUnit Tests](#JunitTests)__
- For more configuration settings see below section __[Configuration](#Configuration)__.

### Configuration<span id="Configuration"><span>
The configuration is done via a YAML file. Normally this would be `jpowermonitor.yaml`. The agent
has multiple ways of getting this configuration:
1. You can pass it as a programm argument, see section above. If not, it will simply assume the name
   and path is `jpowermonitor.yaml`.
2. It first tries to read this path as an external file.
3. If that fails, it tries to load this path from the JAR's resources

For the configuration of the JUnit extension a yaml file with the name of the executed test is searched.

If no base load (`energyInIdleMode`) is specified for a path, this is measured before each test. So a mixed operation between configuration of the base load and measurement is also possible and the results can be compared (some sensors provide very similar values).
For non current measuring sensors (e.g. temperature) the base load is not calculated extra and also not subtracted from the measured value! It is only output if a base load must also be calculated for a current-measuring sensor because this is not specified in the configuration.

### Integration into your own project
#### Java Agent
- You may build the jpowermonitor fat jar using the build target `shadowJar` and the copy the `-all.jar` into a folder of your project.
- You can use this jar for the java agent. Alternatively you may download the fat jar from mvn central [here](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/github/msg-systems/jpowermonitor/).
- For testing call with `java -javaagent:.\build\libs\jpowermonitor-<version>-all.jar[=path-to-jpowermonitor.yaml] -jar .\build\libs\jpowermonitor-<version>-all.jar [runtimeSeconds] [cpuThreads]`
- The second `.\build\libs\jpowermonitor-<version>-all.jar` is just an example and can be replaced by any `jar` of your choice
- The configuration can be passed as a parameter using the `=` sign! If nothing is passed, the default configuration file `jpowermonitor.yaml` is searched.
- For starting the agent with Spring Boot, Servlet-Container etc. please consult the respective documentation for adding a java agent.


#### JUnit Tests<span id="JunitTests"><span>
The add the test dependency to your gradle build (analogue for maven builds):
```
    testImplementation(
        [group: 'io.github.msg-systems', name: 'jpowermonitor', version: jPowerMonitorVersion],
    )
```

The extension is designed for JUnit 5 (jupiter) tests and is included into your test class as follows:
```
@ExtendWith({JPowerMonitorExtension.class})
```

jPowerMonitor then searches for a configuration file with the name of the executed test + `.yaml` extension.
For example if your test is named `MyAlgorithmText.java` then the configuration for jPowerMonitor is expected to be found in `MyAlgorithmText.yaml` somewhere in the classpath.

The tests are best executed as `@RepeatedTests(...)` in order to obtain several measurements. For example always 10 times.
In the result CSV (configuration: `resultCsv`) you can then calculate an average of the results in Excel.

`@SensorValues` annotated fields in the test class of the type `List<SensorValue>` can be retrieved after each test in the `@AfterEach` method.

A `SensorValue` contains the resulting measured value with name of the sensor and the following additional information:
- `Unit unit`: The unit of the value (e.g. W, J, Wh)
- `BigDecimal powerInIdleMode`: The power consumption that has been measured in idle mode.
- `LocalDateTime executionTime`: The execution time of measure.
- `long durationOfTestInNanoSeconds`: The duration of the whole test.
- `BigDecimal valueWithoutIdlePowerPerHour`: The value without the idle power value.
- `BigDecimal valueWithIdlePowerPerHour`: The value together with the idle power value.

The sensor values could be used to create your own output file in your own format.

The file for the measuring points can be configured under `csvRecording.measurementCsv`. jPowerMonitor outputs all considered measurement points (also those of the base load measurement, if it takes place) into this file.

_Please note_: the first `percentageOfSamplesAtBeginningToDiscard`% measurement points are always discarded.

The result file can be configured under `csvRecording.resultCsv`. The summary of energy consumption is written to this file.

The headers of the csv output file are configured in the [csvExport.properties](src%2Fmain%2Fresources%2FcsvExport.properties) (default language English).
The file currently is translated into German and French and is locale dependent.
You may add your own locale and add the translated file to the classpath. You may set the language via JVM option e.g. `-Duser.language=es`.

### Limitations
- There are currently no known limitations.
